This is a team work between Lucky Solomon and Gospel Enoch.
In this task we will:
-> Write a beautiful code that passes the betty checks
-> Write a UNIX command line interpreter
-> Simple shell to:
	handle command line with arguments
	handle the PATH
	fork must not be called if the command doesn't exist
	implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
	usage: exit
	you don't have to handle any argument to the built-in exit
	implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
